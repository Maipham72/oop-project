Online food ordering system

## Description

The Online Food Ordering System is a system that is designed to be utilised at a store where customers use a kiosk to order food and drinks from a fixed menu. The menu will contain information about the food and drinks sold by the store and each customer has a cart and an order ID. The store sells burgers, pizza, and drinks, in which drinks include coffee and bubble milk tea. Customers can customise their food or drinks based on personal preference, such as pizza toppings, type of meat and bun for burgers, or ice and sugar level for drinks. The orderID will be needed for payment. They can then choose the items they want, add it to the cart, view the cart and proceed to payment. Customers can choose either to pay by card with a pre-loaded card provided by the store or pay by cash at the counter. The objective of the system is to provide users with a user-friendly interface to order and pay for their food and drinks.

## Usage

This system is incorporated into the kiosk system at food store to help with ordering process. It is aimed to save time and resources for the store owner and the customers. The system is user-friendly with clean interface and easy to navigate around.
